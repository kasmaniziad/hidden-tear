Entity Data Framework

POCO - Plain Old CLR Object

When creating an instance of a POCO entity type, the Entity Framework creates an instance of a dynamically generated derived type that acts as a proxy for this entity. A POCO entity has some virtual properties, this proxy overrides these virtual properties of this entity to perform an action automatically when the property is accessed
